# Thinking about the controls / search overlay

You should just treat this as another tab, thats
always available, but unselectable in the normal tabs menu

Dont try to have two browser views at the same time for v0

just try to get it working, you can play with transitions and 
opacity later

Read through electron-tabs or the other project about firebase
carefully to see how they manage tabs

impliment a simple version of this, you dont need all their functionality
